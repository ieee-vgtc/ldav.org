# LDAV 2017 - Big Data Analysis and Visualization

Modern large-scale scientific simulations, sensor networks, and experiments are
generating enormous datasets, with some projects approaching the multiple
exabyte range in the near term. Managing and analyzing large datasets in order
to transform it into insight is critical for a variety of disciplines including
climate science, nuclear physics, security, materials design, transportation,
and urban planning. The tools and approaches needed to mine, analyze, and
visualize data at extreme scales can be fully realized only if there are
end-to-end solutions, which demands collective, interdisciplinary efforts.

The 7th IEEE Large Scale Data Analysis and Visualization (LDAV) symposium, to be
held in conjunction with IEEE VIS 2017, is specifically targeting methodological
innovation, algorithmic foundations, and possible end-to-end solutions. The LDAV
symposium will bring together domain scientists, data analysts, visualization
researchers, and users to foster common ground for solving both near- and
long-term problems. Paper submissions are solicited for a long and short paper
tracks. Topic emphasis is on algorithms, languages, systems, and/or hardware
solutions that support the collection, analysis, manipulation, or visualization
of large-scale data.

There are a variety of ways to participate in LDAV 2017 - papers, posters, and
attending. We hope to see you there!
