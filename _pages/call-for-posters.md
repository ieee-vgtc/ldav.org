# Call for Posters

Contact: <posters@ldav.org>

We invite you to submit unpublished work to the IEEE LDAV 2017 Poster Program.
The poster program is a venue designed to highlight ongoing research and late
breaking topics that have produced promising preliminary results. In addition to
the topics listed under Call for Papers, we also welcome submissions that
showcase successful stories of applying visualization to large-scale data
intensive applications. The poster program will be a great opportunity for the
authors to interact with the symposium attendees and solicit feedback.

Interested authors should submit a two-page abstract that describes the
underlying problem, the proposed method, and preliminary results. Accepted
poster abstracts will be included in the symposium proceedings. The format of
the abstract will be the same as the format used for the regular paper
submission. Poster authors are encouraged, but not required, to include a draft
or sketch of the poster layout and content in their submission. This would help
reviewers and show that the poster format is used effectively. The draft poster
should be in PDF format. The authors should indicate if the poster would be
accompanied by an on-site demonstration and/or videos.

### Poster 2-Page Abstract Submission Instructions:

Submitted abstracts may not exceed the maximum of two pages in length. The
abstract should be formatted according to guidelines available on the IEEE VGTC
Website.

### Poster 2-Page Abstract Submission Site:

Go to the [submission site](https://precisionconference.com/~vgtc), log in, go
to 'new submissions', and select 'LDAV 2017 Posters’.

### Layout and Dimensions of the Posters:

The dimensions of the posters should not exceed the A0 space (841mm x 1189mm or
33.1" x 46.8"). The poster authors can determine the layout by themselves, but
please be sure to follow the dimensions described above.

### Best Poster Award:

submission is deemed the strongest according to the reviewing criteria. This
award will be announced at the event.
